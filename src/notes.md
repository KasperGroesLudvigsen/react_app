# Hooks
useState is a hook. 
How to use the useState hook:

import it. 

then declare a state variable within a component using the syntax:

´const [stateVariableName, setStateFunction] = useState(false);´

This creates a variable and a function and the initial value of the variable is set to false. The set state function is used to change the state of the state variable. To change the state variable to true, do this:

setStateFunction(true);
